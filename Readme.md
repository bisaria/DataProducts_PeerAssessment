This app tries to predict 10-year heart attack risk using data from Framingham Heart Study. 

  The user is required to enter the following information:

  * Age
  * Gender
  * Total Cholestrol Level in mg/dL
  * Systolic Blood Pressure, which is the first number from a BP reading.
  * Does he smoke?
  * Is he under any BP medication?
  
Based on these informations, this app tries to predict if the user has any risk of developing heart disease in 10 years time. If the probabilty of risk is more than 50%, the app generates a warning.
